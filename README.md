# x64dbg-exploiting
Do you want to use x64dbg instead of immunity debugger for your buffer overflow task?

Just download: 

https://github.com/David-Reguera-Garcia-Dreg/x64dbg-exploiting/releases/download/1.0/x64dbg-exploitingv1.0.zip

Install python-2.7.11.msi (I use C:\Python27\)

Install python-2.7.11.amd64.msi (I use C:\Python27x64\)

Done!

Open x64dbg-exploitingv1.0\x64dbg\release\x32\x32dbg.exe and x64dbg-exploitingv1.0\x64dbg\release\x64\x64dbg.exe and try it:

File -> Open -> Debug an executable

Go to Log, select **Python** in command line

Write in command line:

import mona

mona.mona("module")

![alt text](command_line_python.png)

![alt text](running_mona_modules_after_import.png)

mona.mona("help") 

mona.mona("help command")

```
